# Learning metalsmith

This repo will walk through [this tutorial](https://web.archive.org/web/20200415053639/https://azurelogic.com/posts/building-a-blog-with-metalsmith/) on creating a blog
through metalsmith, which is a static site generator written entirely in node.js

The goal of this is to figure out if I can package this into an electron app.
